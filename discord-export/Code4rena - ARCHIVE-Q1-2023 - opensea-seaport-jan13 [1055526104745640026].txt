Hey wardens - something we meant to include in the README but forgot to mention is that **we are not interested in gas opts for the conduit controller.** 

During our last contest we received a lot of them — we actually didn't implement any because the code is highly sensitive and not executed frequently, so readability and comprehension is the top priority.

As a reminder, this same logic (no gas optimizations where they damage readability, eg assembly) applies to the reference contracts and constructor logic (and, for the love of all that is good, test contracts). Submissions against any in-scope contract are always welcome if they improve readability and comprehension without sacrificing on safety or (in the core Seaport contract) efficiency.

hey @0age , just taking a first read through the repo, from the changelog vs. Seaport 1.1 I saw that offers including native ETH can be fufilled, will this enable ERC721 -> ETH? iirc this basic order path is not possible on current Seaport


[01/16/2023 03:00] 0age
Why yes indeed it will — contract orders can provide native tokens (eg ETH) as offer items and transfer the associated native tokens to Seaport as part of the generateOrder call

{Reactions}
👍 

[01/16/2023 03:06] 0age
You can imagine a contract offerer that takes WETH and provides ETH (or vice versa), wrapping and unwrapping as needed, and called alongside a listing or offer being accepted using eg matchOrders


[01/16/2023 13:29] supernovahs
What's the most effective way to know the diff in 1.1 and 1.2 in github  easily to compare?

Hello,
`"OpenSea engaged Trail of Bits to audit the security of Seaport. From April 18th to May 12th 2022, a team of Trail of Bits consultants conducted a security review of Seaport. The audit did not uncover significant flaws that could result in the compromise of a smart contract, loss of funds, or unexpected behavior in the target system."`


[01/18/2023 21:56] dewaxindo
So it means it is unlikely wardens can find high or medium bugs? 🤔


[01/18/2023 21:57] itsmetechjay
This has been updated in the README to be by January 25, 2023 at 20:00 UTC. It'll show on the contest page soon.

[01/18/2023 22:47] 0age
This particular audit was for Seaport 1.0; the last seaport c4 still had both high and medium-severity findings (and there’s a good deal of brand new code as well!)


[01/18/2023 22:48] dewaxindo
Thanks for clarifying


[01/19/2023 20:05] chaduke3730
Is this open for all? (not only certified) (not sure as I have the impression of the later by reading from somewhere)


[01/19/2023 20:09] itsmetechjay
This is open for everyone but you need to be certified to receive awards.

[01/20/2023 16:33] 0age
You can find the code for interacting with contract offerers in OrderValidator, see _getGeneratedOrder


[01/20/2023 16:37] 0age
If you want to plug on-chain liquidity into Seaport you can use a contract order, where the offerer is a contract that implements the ContractOffererInterface and approves Seaport or a conduit; then, contract offerers just return orders that meet their own requirements, without requiring a signature or anything. You could imagine liquidation engines for NFT lending, pool contracts like Sudoswap, oracle-based "strategies" that will buy and sell NFTs based on the current floor price, contracts for wrapping and unwrapping ETH, etc.

The Seaport version 1.2 contract is now deployed to many EVM chains! 

0x00000000000006c7676171937C444f6BDe3D6282

The current Seaport contract (v1.1) is still usable & will be as long as whatever chain it's on keeps chugging; v1.2 is a new contract

So, what's v1.2 all about? ⤵️
